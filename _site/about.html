## About

Hi! My name is Will Bryant and I am an aspiring software engineer! <br> I am currently a senior studying Computer Engineering at the Unversity of Michigan and I am pursuing a 5 year masters degree through Michigan's <a href="http://www.rackham.umich.edu/students/navigate-degree/sugs-information" target="_blank">SUGS</a> program. My current interests lie in embedded systems, distributed systems, and operating systems, although I quickly get interested in any cool software projects that come my way! Outside of engineering I spend my time as the CTO &amp; CFO of <a href="https://mpowered.umich.edu/" target="_blank">MPowered Entrepreneurship</a>, the oldest and largest entrepreneurship club at Michigan. <br> Scroll down to learn more! <br>
