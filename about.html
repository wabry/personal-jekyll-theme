## About

Welcome! My name is William Bryant and I am a senior at the University of Michigan.
<br> I am currently majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in Entrepreneurship.
<br> This summer I will be intering at Microsft on a Mircosoft Azure team.
<br> Next year I will receive a masters degree in Computer Engineering through the <a href="http://www.rackham.umich.edu/students/navigate-degree/sugs-information" target="_blank">SUGS program</a>. 
<br> I am interested in distributed systems, operating systems, and embedded systems, although I quickly get interested in any cool software projects that come my way!
